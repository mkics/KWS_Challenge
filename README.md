# KWS-Challenge

Purpose of this project is to develop a Keyword Spotting hardware accelerator using a generative AI(such as Rapidgpt) to use on Caravel System-on-Chip. I will try to efficiently use as many coefficients as I can of the mel-frequency cepstrum algorithm.
If better suited algorithms are found they will be used. The testbenches will also be written by the generative AI(as much as possible).
